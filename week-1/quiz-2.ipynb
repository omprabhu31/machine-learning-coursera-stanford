    "Consider the problem of predicting how well a student does in her second year of college/university, given how well she did in her first year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let $x$ be equal to the number of \"A\" grades (including A-, A and A+ grades) that a student receives in their first year of college (freshmen year). We would like to predict the value of $y$, which we define as the number of \"A\" grades they get in their second year (sophomore year).\n",

    "Many substances that can burn (such as gasoline and alcohol) have a chemical structure based on carbon atoms; for this reason they are called hydrocarbons. A chemist wants to understand how the number of carbon atoms in a molecule affects how much energy is released when that molecule combusts (meaning that it is burned). The chemist obtains the dataset below. In the column on the right, “kJ/mol” is the unit measuring the amount of energy released.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let $f$ be some function so that $f(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ outputs a number. For this problem, $f$ is some arbitrary/unknown smooth function (not necessarily the cost function of linear regression, so $f$ may have local optima). Suppose we use gradient descent to try to minimize $f(\\theta_0, \\theta_1)$ as a function of $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$. Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)\n",

    "* If $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are initialized at a local minimum, then one iteration will not change their values\n",
    "* If $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ are initialized so that $\\theta_0 = \\theta_1$, then by symmetry (because we do simultaneous updates to the two parameters), after one iteration of gradient descent, we will still have $\\theta_0 = \\theta_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 - False. If $\\alpha$ is very large, then gradient descent might result in overshooting the minimum. It may also fail to converge or even diverge in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 - True. The value of $\\alpha$ defines the step size with each iteration of gradient descent. A low learning rate means that gradient descent will be slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 3 - True. At a local minimum, the partial derivatives involved in the gradient descent algorithm will equal zero. This will lead to updating $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ with a zero value (i.e. they remain same). In fact, no matter the number of iterations, the values of $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ will always stay constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4 - False. Just because $\\theta_0 = \\theta_1$ does not mean that the partial derivative of the cost function with respect to $\\theta_0$, $\\theta_1$ will be equal. For example consider the function $f(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = \\theta_0^2 + 2\\theta_0\\theta_1$ at $\\theta_0 = \\theta_1 = 1$."

    "\n",
    "Suppose that for some linear regression problem (say, predicting housing prices as in the lecture), we have some training set, and for our training set we managed to find some $\\theta_0,\\theta_1$ such that $J(\\theta_0, \\theta_1) = 0$.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1 - False. For the cost function to be zero, we require the error terms to be zero. Individual values of $y$ and $h$ can be non-zero, but must be equal for every value of $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2 - False. For linear regression, the local minimum is equal to the global minimum.\n",

    "Option 3 - False. For the cost function to be zero, we require the error terms to be zero. $\\theta_0$ and $\\theta_1$ can be non-zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 4 - True. Since the cost function is a sum of squares (essentially all positive quantities), each of the squared error terms must be zero. Hence, the values of $h$ and $y$ must be the same for all values of $i$, i.e. the function values coincide at all points and hence, all values lie on the same line."
