    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E\" - Tom Mitchell\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a weather prediction algorithm which takes from historical weather data to predict future weather:\n",
    "\n",
    "* E = The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data\n",
    "* T = The weather prediction task\n",
    "* P = The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "*Supervised learning* is the task of finding out a potential relationship between input and output variables given a labelled dataset to learn from (i.e. make an \"informed\" prediction). SL problems can be broadly categorized into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* regression - predict results within a continuous output (predicting tomorrow's average temperature in degrees Celsius; predicting the price of houses given a record of previous house prices vs house area)\n",
    "* classification - predict results within a discrete output (predicting tomorrow's weather as being either Stormy, Cloudy or Rainy; predicting whether or not a house will sell for a given price and area based on a labelled training set)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In *unsupervised learning*, datasets do not have labelled outputs and predictions are often made by clustering data based on relationships among variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* clustering - given a large set of spam mails, figure out if there are different types of spam\n",
    "* non-clustering - [the cocktail party problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_party_effect)"

For a matrix $A$, $A_{ij}$ (sometimes expressed as $a_{ij}$) refers to the term present in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column.\n",
