# machine-learning-coursera-stanford

This repository contains a bunch of reference notes, lecture slides, quiz solutions and programming assignment solutions for the course titled 'Machine Learning' provided by Stanford University on Coursera. This is mainly only for my reference in the future, but you may freely browse the repo for anything that might interest you and even fork it for easier access. 

I will make sure the notes as well as solutions are as accurate as possible, but unintended grammatical/technical errors may occur sometimes. If you stumble upon any, feel free to contact me using the options listed on the [contact page on my website](https://omprabhu31.github.io/contact/).

Please do not redistribute the files anywhere else and/or use the solutions for purposes that violate the honor code of the course.

Why do I use `.ipynb` files, you ask? Well, because GitHub markdown sucks and doesn't even support basic LaTeX :/
