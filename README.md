This repository contains a bunch of reference notes, lecture slides, quiz solutions and programming assignment solutions for the course Machine Learning provided by Stanford University on Coursera. Please do not redistribute the files anywhere else and/or use the solutions for purposes that violate the honor code of the course.

Why do I use `.ipynb` files, you ask? Well, because GitHub markdown sucks and doesn't even support basic LaTeX :/
