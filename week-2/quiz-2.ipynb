    "In Octave/Matlab, many functions work on single numbers, vectors, and matrices. For example, the `sin` function when applied to a matrix will return a new matrix with the sine of each element. But you have to be careful, as certain functions have different behavior. Suppose you have an $7\\times 7$ matrix $X$. You want to compute the log of every element, the square of every element, add 1 to every element, and divide every element by 4. You will store the results in four matrices, $A, B, C, D$. One way to do so is the following code:\n",
